# Overview

Practice problems to learn about Either Left and Right.

## Prerequisite
1. Follow readme in root project.

## What to do
1. `index.ts` includes key functions:
    - `checkPassword()` is a non-functional programing style with unit test but poor results.
    - `eitherCheckPasswordAdd()` is incomplete but has failing unit tests, follow the todos to make all tests pass.
1. In the root directory, run `npm run test:either` from inside this folder.
1. Once the `eitherCheckPasswordAdd` unit tests all pass, you're done!
1. (Optional) check the answers folder to see how I solved it.
