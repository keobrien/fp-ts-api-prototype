# Overview

Practice problems to learn about Option/Maybe.

## Prerequisite
1. Follow readme in root project.

## What to do
1. `index.ts` includes key functions:
    - `fancyAdd()` is incomplete but has failing unit tests, follow the todo comments to make all tests pass.
1. In the root directory, run `npm run test:option` from inside this folder.
1. Once the `fancyAdd` unit tests all pass, you're done!
1. (Optional) check the answers folder to see how I solved it.
