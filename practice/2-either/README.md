# Overview

Practice problems to learn about Option/Maybe.

## Prerequisite
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), consider using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
1. run `npm install`

## What to do
1. `index.ts` includes key functions:
    - `add()` is a non-functional programing style function with unit test but poor results.
    - `maybeAdd()` is a functional programing style function with unit test and better input handeling.
    - `fancyAdd()` is incomplete but has unit tests, follow the todos to make all tests pass.
1. run `npm test` from inside this folder.
1. Once the `fancyAdd` unit tests all pass, you're done!
