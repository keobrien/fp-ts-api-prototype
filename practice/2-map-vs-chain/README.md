# Overview

Practice problems to learn about Map vs Chain with Option.

## Prerequisite
1. Follow readme in root project.

## What to do
1. `index.ts` includes key functions:
    - `add()` is a non-functional programing style with unit test but prone to issues.
    - `maybeAdd()` is a functional programing style with unit test and better input handeling.
1. In the root directory, run `npm run test:mapChain` from inside this folder.
